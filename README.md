## Vision
GeoMusica will be a website enabling people to connect and explore music with places. It can be used for exploring local music, exploring what music
is unique or popular at different places, explore what type of music other people connect to places, and sorting/storing the music you have connected 
with places. 

The app should be easy to use and there will be enough users and user generated content to explore local music for a roadtrip. There will also be some automatically generated content, playlists like "This is CityX" containing music from CityX.

After the summer 22 there will be a version that at least supports users to add music and use the *Near me*-function.  

## Example of users
- **Roadtrippers**. People who travel and want to explore local music can do so by using the *Near me*-function and choosing *Unique* over *Popular*,
to get music that is unique for the places they pass. 

- **Musical explorers**. People who from home explores music through the map in the *Explore*-view. 

- **Nostalgics**. People who have memories of places connected to music and want to relive those places by listening to the music can do so by 
storing their song-places in playlists in their *Library*.

- **Solo drivers**. People who drive solo, for example truck drivers, can use the *Route*-function. That way they can set up a mix of their own playlist
and local music before a drive so they won't need to plicka på mobilen while driving.

- **Connectors**. People who connect places to music and want to connect with how other people connect places to music. For example, users can connect 
songs to forests to represent the vibe of the forest. Other users might connect the skate-park in Umeå with Fricky, Råsunda with "Å vi e AIK", or a Paris 
square with "Lobo-Hombre En Paris".  


## Similar apps + what they lack
- [Roadtrip Mixtape](https://developer.spotify.com/community/showcase/roadtrip-mixtape/) Content is not user generated, does not seem to be maintained. 
- [MusicMapper](https://thenextweb.com/news/musicmapper-app-is-for-music-loving-geo-location-fanatics) Lacks functionality to play, queue, create playlists. 
Not maintained?
- [Spotify prototype](https://bootcamp.uxdesign.cc/ui-case-study-discover-local-artists-with-spotify-local-scene-92f11c39edae) Seems to be more about 
exploring artists by city. 
- [MusicPlaces](https://musicplaces.org/es) Seems to be more about historical music. Also seems like contributors and users are separated. 
- [GeoTunes](https://github.com/kainan54/Mod4-project-geoTunes) Only supports routes with associated playlists (does not use user location). GeoMusica will have similiar functionality with the *Route*-function or eventually by sharing *Playlist*s, except for that your location will determine what song will be played. 
- [GeoMusic](https://github.com/soo-park/geomusic) Only supports playlist play by location. 
- [Music Where You Are](https://www.musicwhereyouare.com/) Not user generated content. 
- [Soundtrckr](https://www.wired.com/2009/12/soundtrckr-is-spot-on-like-a-location-aware-pandora/) From 2009, geotagging songs, had notifications.
